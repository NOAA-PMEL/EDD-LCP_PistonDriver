# EDD-LCP_PistonDriver
Repository for LCP Piston Driver PCB design and firmware.

This repository is home to the piston driver PCB design and firmware for the low-cost-profiler project (likely to be renamed).
## State of this project
The electrical/embedded engineer has left this project and therefore the project is incomplete.  As of leaving, the piston does move to requested locations to within 0.008".  

### Future work
An RTOS should be added to this project to allow for i2c calls while movements are in progress.#

## Branch
Develop has been merged with master until this project is picked back up
