# EDD-LCP_PistonDriver
Repository for LCP Piston Driver PCB design and firmware.

This repository is home to the piston driver PCB design and firmware for the low-cost-profiler project (likely to be renamed).

## GCC Build System
master_gcc branch is compatible with gcc compiler for MSP430 MCU. Please follow the steps below on the linux terminal.

* ./run_script.sh
* source ~/.bashrc
* cd Firmware/LCP_PistonDriver/
* make
* make flash

## State of this project
The LCP has been extensilivly tested and deployed in Puget Sound and the Bering Sea in Moored mode.  The mechanical design is complete, the electronics hardware needs a goround-up re-design for lower power consumption, decreased cost, and robustness.  The Firmware needs a ground up re-write for robustnuss and readability.  The piston board should be merged with the LCP-Control Board, and the seperate micro-controller elminated if possible.

# Branch
Master_gcc is the active branch and encompasses the most upto date version of the project 

# Low-Cost-Profiler
Low Cost Profiler for Oceanographic Monitoring
